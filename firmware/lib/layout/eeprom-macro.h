 * EEPROM macro interface
 *
 * Prefix: `eeprom_macro__`
 *
 * This file is meant to be included and used by the keyboard layout
 * implementation.
 *
 *
 * Usage notes:
 *
 * - These functions will play back keystrokes, not actions.  This means that
 *   new macro definitions may affect old ones.  It also means that different
 *   keyboard states may lead to different actions being performed for the same
 *   macro (if, say, the layer the macro is on is mostly transparent, and there
 *   is a different layer underneath it on a subsequent press than there was
 *   during definition).
 *
 * - Even though `eeprom_macro__uid_t` has distinct fields, there is nothing
 *   that says the calling function(s) must maintain the semantic meanings of
 *   those fields.  I imagine that under most circumstances one would want to,
 *   but as long as the '.c' file implementing this interface agree (or at
 *   least work) with whatever the calling functions are doing, things should
 *   be fine.
 *
 *     - For example, if there were a layout implementation that ignored
 *       layers, but wanted to manually map different key combinations to
 *       different macros for a given key, this could be done by repurposing
 *       the `layer` field to mean "key combination id" (or some such thing).

/**                                       types/eeprom_macro__uid_t/description
 * A Unique IDentifier for a macro; also a convenient way to specify a position
 * in the layer matrix
 *
 * Notes:
 * - This format artificially limits the number of layers, rows, and columns
 *   that can be specified to 2^5 = 32 each.  This seems like it'd be hard to
 *   reach practically, but it's much less than the limit of 2^8 possible
 *   values each imposed by most of the rest of the firmware, so it's worth
 *   noting.
 *     - An alternate method would be to use all 15 bits (since 1 of the 16
 *       available bits is allocated to `pressed`) to represent a layer matrix
 *       index calculated according to the normal rules of array indexing for
 *       some `[layer][row][column]`.  The current method is preferred because
 *       it makes it much easier to extract the component values (which is
 *       helpful in grouping the macros, which is helpful in macro seek time
 *       optimizations).
 *     - 15 bits in *some* format should always be enough to uniquely identify
 *       every possible macro.  On the ATMega32U4 it would be impossible to
 *       exceed this, since it only has 32256 bytes of PROGMEM to begin with.
 *       Even if there was more, however, it seems unlikely that more than
 *       2^15 = 32768 positions would be specified by any layer matrix.

// === eeprom_macro__record__start ===
/**                           functions/eeprom_macro__record__start/description
 * Start recording keystrokes to the EEPROM, for the creation of a macro
 *
 * Arguments:
 * - `skip`: The number of keystrokes to skip before beginning to record
 *
 * Returns:
 * - success: `0`
 * - failure: [other] (not enough memory left to record)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Skipping keystrokes may be useful, for example, if the using function
 *   wants to define the first key pressed after this function is called as the
 *   key to assign the macro to, rather than as part of the macro.

 * Stop recording keystrokes, and finalize the macro
 *
 * Arguments:
 * - `skip`: The number of keystrokes at the end of our recording to ignore
 * - `index`: The UID of this macro
 *
 * Returns:
 * - success: `0`
 * - failure: [other] (macro was too long to fit in EEPROM)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Before this function is called, the macro should not be referenced
 *   anywhere in the EEPROM.

 * Arguments:
 * - `index`: The UID of the macro to play
 *
 * Returns:
 * - `0`: Macro successfully played
 * - [other]: Error (macro does not exist)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Keystrokes will be played back as if the same sequence of keys were being
 *   pressed by the user (regardless of whether the current state of the
 *   keyboard is the same), except as fast as possible (since timing is not
 *   recorded).

 *   find a macro for any `index`.  This does not necessarily imply that the
 *   EEPROM is in a fully known state.
